   MMap Class - Provides 'real' mmap or a faked mmap using read().

   The purpose of this code is to provide a generic way for clients to
   access the mmap function. In enviroments that do not support mmap
   from file fd's this function will use read and normal allocated 
   memory.
   
   Writing to a public mmap will always fully comit all changes when the 
   class is deleted. Ie it will rewrite the file, unless it is readonly

   The DynamicMMap class is used to help the on-disk data structure 
   generators. It provides a large allocated workspace and members
   to allocate space from the workspace in an effecient fashion.
   
   This source is placed in the Public Domain, do with it what you will
   It was originally written by Jason Gunthorpe.
